## Running the Application
Start the application:
   ```bash
      mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
Test endpoints:
````
GET /stats - View thread statistics

POST /api/users/process-batch?count=10 - Process multiple users concurrently

GET /api/sequential?count=10 - Test sequential API calls

GET /api/virtual-threads?count=10 - Test virtual threads API calls

GET /benchmark/compare?requestCount=1000 - Compare performance
````
Key Advantages Demonstrated
- Massive Concurrency: Handle thousands of concurrent I/O operations with minimal memory overhead

- Simplified Code: Write synchronous-looking code that performs asynchronously

- Better Resource Utilization: No need for complex reactive programming patterns

- Improved Performance: Significant reduction in response times for I/O-bound operations

- Platform Thread Conservation: Avoid thread pool exhaustion with lightweight virtual threads

The example shows how virtual threads enable handling high numbers of concurrent requests efficiently, making them ideal for microservices architectures with numerous external API calls.

## Monitoring
You can monitor the H2 database console at:

text
http://localhost:8080/h2-console
Use JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb, Username: sa, Password: (leave blank)
